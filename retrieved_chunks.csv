The application provides an easy way to enter any structured format via the web and generates quality data quickly Built for 3G connections and above, and available on all common browsers and devices An entry to a wide array of interactive tools and reports which allow users to intelligently investigate and analyse data Built for big data and tested on the largest projects in Asia A repository for all data with upload and download functional features ![image:db://images/271](db://images/271) MissionOS has been developed over the last 20 years utilising data structures which originated from the Channel Tunnel in the United Kingdom. Originally in standalone databases, the system has evolved through LAN and LAN/WAN compatible multi-access databases into the current form. The application now resides fully on the web and is built within the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) framework. This simple scripting platform has proven resilient to change and has evolved rapidly to provide a rich experience to web users.
